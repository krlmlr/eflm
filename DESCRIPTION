Description: A C++ re-implementation of glm() that offers the eglm() function
 with a significant speedup when the number of observations is larger than the
 number of parameters to estimate. The iteratively reweighted least squares 
 implementation utilizes the step-halving approach of Marschner (2011) 
 <doi:10.32614/RJ-2011-012> to help safeguard against convergence issues.
 The best computational performance is obtained when R is linked against 
 OpenBLAS, Intel MKL or other optimized BLAS library. This implementation aims 
 at being compatible with R default output and also with 'broom' and 'sandwich'
 packages for summary statistics and clustering by providing S3 methods.
